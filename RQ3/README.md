# RQ3 — Bridge Proteins Between Drug Communities

This folder contains data, code, and results for identifying protein targets that are hit by
FDA-approved cancer drugs from multiple drug communities.

## Data
- `RQ3/data/cancer_0.2.csv` - Drug-target dataset (FDA-approved cancer drug-target interactions).
- `RQ3/data/target_name_clean.csv` — ChEMBL target ID to gene symbol mapping used to produce readable protein names.

## R Code
- `RQ3/code/rq3_bridge_proteins.R` — builds the drug–target bipartite network, projects a drug–drug network,
  detects drug communities with Louvain, and computes:
  - `n_drug_communities`
  - `n_drugs`

Bridge proteins are defined as targets with `n_drug_communities ≥ 2`.

## Results
- `RQ3/results/bridge_targets_q3.csv` — ranked bridge-protein summary table generated by the script.
- `RQ3/results/view_resulting_table_.png` — screenshot of the ranked bridge-protein table.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies, set your working directory, and run the script:
```r
# 1) Install dependency
install.packages("igraph")

# 2) Set working directory to the project root
setwd("~/Network-Analysis-of-FDA-Approved-Cancer-Drugs-and-Protein-Interactions")

# 3) Run the RQ3 script
source("RQ3/code/rq3_bridge_proteins.R")
